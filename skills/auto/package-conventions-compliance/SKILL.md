name: package-conventions-compliance
description: Use when a coding task asks to fix bugs or add features in an existing package that has documented conventions (type hints, changelog, regression tests, style rules).
---
When a task involves modifying a package, treat the repository's stated conventions as part of the deliverable, not optional polish.

1. Before editing, scan the repo for convention sources: README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, docs/, config files, and any rules stated in the task prompt.
2. Enumerate every convention that applies to your change and write them as a checklist.
3. For each public function you touch or add (name not starting with `_`), add type annotations on ALL parameters and on the return value.
4. Add a regression test file at the conventional path (e.g. `tests/test_regressions.py`) with one test function per bug fixed, at least the required minimum count.
5. Record each fix in the changelog under the required heading (e.g. `## Unreleased`) using the required bullet format, one bullet per fix, meeting the minimum count.
6. Run the full test suite AND the new regression tests; both must pass before finishing.
7. Self-check: re-read the convention checklist and confirm each item is satisfied in the final files, not just in your plan.
